Because of how my room is sized, you can't see clearly without turning off some of the walls. I've put some objects on layers so you can easily turn off to see around the room. I had to do this to take pictures from some angles.

I made each object separately then imported - not sure how that would look on the final design but if you need the files, I can send separately.

Thanks,
Michael
